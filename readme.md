# Aviator Game System Design

## Overview
The Aviator game is a popular online betting game that operates on a web socket for real-time interaction. Players place bets on a virtual airplane that takes off and flies away. The goal is to cash out before the plane "flies away" (crashes), with the multiplier increasing as the plane ascends.

## Key Components

### 1. User Interface (UI)
The UI is designed to be intuitive and engaging. Key elements include:
- **Betting Panel:** Allows users to place bets. Users can input the amount they wish to bet and confirm it.
- **Auto Bet:** An option for users to set automatic bets for consecutive rounds.
- **Cash Out Button:** Allows users to cash out their bets at any time before the plane crashes.
- **Multiplier Display:** Shows the current multiplier value as the plane ascends.
- **Leaderboard:** Displays the top bets and their respective multipliers.
- **Chat Window:** Allows users to interact with each other and possibly receive tips or strategies.

### 2. Betting System
The betting system is the core of the game. Here’s how it works:
- **Bet Placement:** Users place bets using the betting panel. The minimum and maximum bet amounts are predefined.
- **Bet Confirmation:** Once a bet is placed, it is confirmed and deducted from the user's balance.
- **Bet Tracking:** The system tracks all active bets and their respective multipliers.

### 3. Real-Time Multiplier
The multiplier starts at 1x and increases as the plane ascends. Key points:
- **Random Crash Point:** The plane crashes at a random point, determined by a provably fair algorithm to ensure fairness.
- **Multiplier Increase:** The multiplier increases over time, and users can cash out at any point before the crash.
- **Cash Out:** If a user cashes out before the crash, their bet is multiplied by the current multiplier. If the plane crashes before they cash out, they lose their bet.

### 4. WebSocket Communication
WebSocket is used for real-time communication between the client and the server. This ensures:
- **Real-Time Updates:** The multiplier value, bet status, and other game events are updated in real-time.
- **Low Latency:** Minimizes delay in bet placement, cash out, and multiplier updates.
- **Scalability:** Handles multiple users simultaneously without significant performance degradation.

### 5. Leaderboard and Chat
The leaderboard and chat enhance the social aspect of the game:
- **Leaderboard:** Displays the top bets and their multipliers, encouraging competition among users.
- **Chat Window:** Allows users to communicate with each other, share strategies, and provide tips. This can also be used for customer support.

### 6. Payment and Withdrawal System
The payment system handles deposits, bets, and withdrawals:
- **Deposits:** Users can deposit funds into their accounts to place bets.
- **Withdrawals:** Users can withdraw their winnings. The system ensures secure and timely transactions.
- **Balance Management:** Keeps track of the user's balance, deducting bets and adding winnings in real-time.

## System Flow
1. **User Registration/Login:** Users register or log in to their accounts.
2. **Deposit Funds:** Users deposit funds into their accounts.
3. **Place Bets:** Users place bets using the betting panel.
4. **Game Starts:** The plane takes off, and the multiplier starts increasing.
5. **Real-Time Updates:** The multiplier value is updated in real-time via WebSocket.
6. **Cash Out:** Users can cash out at any time before the plane crashes.
7. **Game Ends:** The plane crashes at a random point. Users who cashed out before the crash win their bet multiplied by the current multiplier. Those who didn’t lose their bet.
8. **Withdraw Winnings:** Users can withdraw their winnings from their accounts.

## Conclusion
The Aviator game is a dynamic and engaging betting game that leverages real-time communication via WebSocket to provide an immersive experience. The combination of a user-friendly interface, a robust betting system, and social features like the leaderboard and chat makes it a popular choice among online gamers.

By understanding these components, developers can design and implement similar systems, ensuring a seamless and fair gaming experience for users.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Game Loop
- **Round Initialization:** Each round starts with a betting phase (visible in screenshots where users can place bets).
- **Flight Phase:** An airplane starts flying on a curved trajectory. A multiplier value increases as the plane flies higher (e.g., 1.39x, 2.88x seen in screenshots).
- **Crash Event:** Round ends when the plane crashes ("FLEW AWAY!" message appears). The final multiplier is displayed (e.g., 2.88x in screenshot). Winners and losers are determined. Payouts are calculated and distributed.

### Technical Architecture

#### Frontend Components
- **Real-time Display:** Animated airplane on curved trajectory, live multiplier counter, betting interface with quick-select amounts, previous results history.
- **User Interface Elements:** All Bets/My Bets/Top tabs for bet viewing, live bet placement panels, auto-bet functionality, tournament information banner, balance display (showing KES currency).

#### Backend Systems
- **WebSocket Server:** Maintains real-time connections with all players, broadcasts game state updates, handles bet placements and cashouts, manages game rounds and state transitions.
- **Game Logic:** Random crash point generation, multiplier calculation and progression, bet validation and processing, winner determination, payout calculation.
- **Tournament System:** "xTournament: Collect Highest Multiplier" feature, tracks player performance, manages tournament rules and rewards.

#### Data Models
- **Player Data:**
  ```typescript
  interface Player {
      id: string;          // Masked as "2***6" in UI
      balance: number;     // In KES
      activeBets: Bet[];
      tournamentStats: TournamentStats;
  }
  ```
- **Bet Data:**
  ```typescript
  interface Bet {
      id: string;
      playerId: string;
      amount: number;      // In KES
      placedAt: timestamp;
      cashoutMultiplier?: number;
      status: 'active' | 'won' | 'lost';
  }
  ```
- **Round Data:**
  ```typescript
  interface Round {
      id: string;
      startTime: timestamp;
      crashPoint: number;
      participants: Bet[];
      status: 'betting' | 'flying' | 'crashed';
      finalMultiplier: number;
  }
  ```

#### Real-time Communication Flow
- **Round Start:**
  ```json
  {
      type: 'ROUND_START',
      data: {
          roundId: string,
          startTime: timestamp,
          bettingPhase: boolean
      }
  }
  ```
- **Multiplier Updates:**
  ```json
  {
      type: 'MULTIPLIER_UPDATE',
      data: {
          multiplier: number,
          timestamp: timestamp
      }
  }
  ```
- **Crash Event:**
  ```json
  {
      type: 'CRASH',
      data: {
          finalMultiplier: number,
          winners: Array<{playerId: string, payout: number}>,
          nextRoundStart: timestamp
      }
  }
  ```

## Security Considerations
- **Bet Validation:** Maximum and minimum bet limits, balance verification, duplicate bet prevention, rate limiting on bet placement.
- **Anti-Cheat Measures:** Server-side crash point generation, timestamp validation, client-server state synchronization, automated betting detection.
- **Fair Play:** Provably fair algorithms for crash points, transparent multiplier calculation, historical results verification, licensed operation verification.

## Scalability Considerations
- **Connection Management:** WebSocket connection pooling, load balancing for multiple game instances, connection state recovery, heartbeat monitoring.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient state broadcasting, batch updates for non-critical data, connection throttling during high load, cache frequently accessed data.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** SQLite
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** Google strategy
- **Payments:** PayPal SDKs for payouts
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets
- **Frontend:** React with RTK Query

## Tasks
- Implement the authentication flow with Google.
- Integrate the PayPal payout system.
- Add more game logic for betting and crash points.
- Create the frontend React components.
- Ensure all game logic in the description above is implemented with multiple error handlers.
